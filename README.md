i have specifed border and margin to 0 using unviersal selector (selects everthing). This is done to remove any default spacing property of any elements

box sizing border box ensure that content does not exceed space allocated to screen ie not to overflow

in line not 8 to 10 i have spacified grid format 

here display is set to grid and the grid-template-columns and row diamensions are defined

grid column 1/17 says that item should allocated space between line no 1 to 17 ie all top column

gird row 1/2 says that the with of rectangle should be one column, in this case it is 6rem ie 96px

border property is used to give a border to the box

here i have also used flex so display flex is written 

justify content is the spacing property used 

align items is a spacing property along y axis (non main axis)

padding is applied on left and right side of space =14%

for each button i have given background color as black and color of text as white; borderr radius is used to make corners rounded

for all the images have put:

background position as center so that image gets focussed on center and not any side 

backgound repeat: image multiple times if the diamnesion of the image does to match with allocated space to avoid this no repeat is sued 

and for each image i have spacifed spacing prperty enterned  manually

Thank you
